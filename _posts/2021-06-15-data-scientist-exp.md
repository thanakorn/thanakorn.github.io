***Data Scientist*** is considered to be a luxurious job these days. With the huge amount of data available nowadays, building business advantages from these data is indispensable for any organization that wants to be successful. TData scientist seems to be a very technical role as people in this profession require to have a good grasp of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. However, what I found from my experience is soft skills play a crucial role in this position too. Unlike in the academic world where you can do most of the things yourself or only talk with those with a similar background, this working approach is not suitable in the industry where your work is only a part of a much bigger system. Good data scientists need to be very skilled at explaining complicated concepts to ordinary people so they know what to expect and how data science is going to fit in the solution.his makes companies, both big and small ones, start building their data scientist team.

It has been around 6 months that I've been working in the data science field which I believe is enough time to say that I start to get a sense of the field. Therefore, I write this article to share the 3 key lessons I've learned with the hope that it could be useful for those who just started a data scientist career like myself or those who plan to do so.

*Disclaimer: What I've written in this article comes from my personal experience which might be different from others who are in a different context.*

# Lesson 1: Not everything is cool.

Outsiders usually have a perception that the data scientist job is cool and challenging because it involves crunching numbers, working with mathematics equations, and building complicated models. Although those tasks are attractive, they are probably only half of the works that data scientists do day-to-day.
	
There are also other parts that are tedious, undesirable, and time-consuming such as acquiring/cleaning/labeling data, polishing the requirements, and ruling out unreasonable ideas. Even though boring as they sound, they are as important as other cool stuff people think data scientists are doing. So, in order to the job well, data scientists can't afford to be picky about the tasks and be prepared for undesirable work.

# Lesson 2: People don't know what is Data Science.

Despite how badly a company wants to gain insights from their data, the truth is most people understand data science superficially. To them, machine learning is a magic box that you put anything in and it will spit out a wonderful answer. This misunderstanding frequently leads to unrealistic expectations that cause troubles not only for data scientists but other people involving in the project too.
	
Therefore, the first thing data scientists get to deal with is not the data as it supposed to be but the people who want to exploit that data. The key is to explain data science concepts in a way that ordinary people can understand so that they have a better sense of what can and cannot do. If this is done properly, the project will have a more realistic goal and be in a much better direction which benefits everyone involved.

# Lesson 3: It's not a solo work.

Using data to solve real-world problems is totally different from doing academic research for two crucial reasons. First, academic research is usually conducted using publicly available data while data in the real world is acquired by complex data pipelines. Second, academic works produce models and the theories supporting their results but, when you work in the industry, companies want workable software or service that their customers can use. These data pipelines, products, and services are usually built by other teams which means the data scientist team cannot deliver the product by itself.

The key to working in such an environment is to broaden your knowledge so you can understand the work of other teams better.  Learning concepts in software and data engineering as well as familiarize yourself with the company's tech stack outside of your team, even the basic ones, will make communication and collaboration between the data scientist team and others smooth and productive, which is necessary for delivering great products.
